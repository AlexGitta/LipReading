README

I zipped my models seperately as they are almost 100mb each when zipped. If you want to test the model yourself, just download 60epochmodel and it to the models/ directory.

To run this notebook use the following

Dataset from https://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gridcorpus/ (Speaker 20 and 11 used in my notebook)

Python 3.10
tensorflow 2.15
opencv-python 4.6.0.66
matplotlib

I also used CUDA 12.2, CUDNN 8.9 and TensorRT = 8.6 for GPU computation on Ubuntu 24.04, however these are not necessary for CPU computation.
